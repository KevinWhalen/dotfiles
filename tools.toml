# Went back and forth for a minute about markdown vs TOML. Decided that even
# though this likely will not ever be machine read, the little bit of rigidity
# from TOML may force a cleaner structure for future updates. Besides
# maintenance another format was desired in the future, it would be simple to
# generate from such a small TOML structure.
